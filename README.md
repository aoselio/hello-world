# hello-world
General repository for project ideas and any collaboration efforts
I am a recent MBA graduate still searching for my first job. I have been tutoring college students online mostly in calculus and precalculus courses to provide some income while I continue my search, but I hope to find my starting job soon. I want to work in a data analytics or data science job if possible. I took analytics classes while getting my MBA and I am trying to learn as much as I can by finding personal projects to work on during my job search. I also have experience working in healthcare and I would love to find a way to use data science into a healthcare position. For a first job, however, any job where I can continue to learn and contribute to useful projects will be incredible to find.
